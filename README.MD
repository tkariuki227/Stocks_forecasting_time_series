## üìù Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting stock market trends using time series data from the *Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE)*. We use historical data from 2021 to identify stock price trends, sector performance, and volatility patterns. We also forecast future prices using advanced modeling techniques.

The goal is to provide valuable insights for investors, analysts, and policymakers using data science.

## üìÅ Dataset Understanding

- *Source:* Scraped from the official Nairobi Stock Exchange website.  [here](https://www.nse.co.ke/dataservices/)
- *Time Period:* 2021 (Daily frequency)  
- *Rows:* 64,688  
- *Key Columns:*  
  - Date  
  - Code (Stock symbol)  
  - Name (Company name)  
  - Day High, Day Low, Day Price  
  - Previous Price, Change, Change %  
  - Volume, Adjusted Price  

---

## üßπ Data Preparation

- Cleaned and formatted numerical columns  
- Converted date strings to datetime format  
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values  
- Created time series per stock for trend analysis and modeling
- Use of pipelines for preprocessing.

---

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized stock price movements over time  
- Analyzed daily returns to identify volatile stocks  
- Grouped and compared performance by sector  
- Highlighted key trends in top stocks like *Safaricom* and *Equity Bank*

## üß† Forecasting Models Used

### 1. *ARIMA*  

Statistical model that uses past values and lagged differences to make forecasts. Suitable for linear, stationary data.

### 2. *Prophet*

Model by Facebook for easy, interpretable time series forecasting. Captures trends, seasonality, and holidays.

### 3. *LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)*  

A deep learning model ideal for time-dependent data. Captures non-linear, complex patterns using memory cells.  
Used to forecast Safaricom stock prices, showing good ability to follow actual trends.

## Evaluation

- **Metrics:** RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) for prediction accuracy.
- **Validation:** Comparing models using cross-validation and visualizing user-level predictions.
- **Selection:** Choosing the best-performing model based on accuracy and robustness.

## Model Deployment

The trained recommendation model is deployed as an interactive web application using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). Users can input their preferences and receive personalized movie recommendations in real time.


- **Access:** Run the Streamlit app locally with:
  
  ```bash
  streamlit run app/nse.py
  ```
